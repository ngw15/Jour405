title: "HW2 Prince George's County Crime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset reporting the number of crimes by month in Prince George's County, Maryland, for every month in 2024. 

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse

You will need to load the tidyverse library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_crime_totals_2024.csv. You will create a dataframe called `pg_crime` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data and Describe It

```{r}
pgcounty_crime <-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_crime_totals_2024.csv")
```
### Task 3: Describe the Data

You should examine that dataframe carefully by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the categories of incidents. From a reporting standpoint, are any of the categories more important than others? Why or why not? Do any of them make the job of summarizing the data more difficult? Why or why not?

The highest category is accidents (I assume that means car accidents) which is interesting. From a reporting standpoint, I'd look into the traffic laws and where these accidents are happening to see if there's more going on with the location or the laws or something. Accident with impound is also a lot highter than what you would expect. I'd look into the police conduct to see why that's so high. I don't think any category will be hard to summarize with like mean, mode and stuff. The only one that looks like it might have any outliers is auto stolen. 

### Task 4: Calculating Averages
Calculate the total number of incidents for each category using `mutate()`, calling the new column `total_incidents`"
 Then calculate the average number of incidents per month for each category of crime, calling the new column `average_incidents`. Assign the result to a new dataframe called `pg_crime_averages`.

```{r}
total_incidents<-pgcounty_crime %>% 
  mutate(total=Jan+Feb+Mar+Apr+May+Jun+Jul+Aug+Sep+Oct+Nov+Dec)
  average_incidents<-total_incidents %>%
  mutate(average = (total/12))
  
pgcounty_crime<-average_incidents
```

### Task 5: Describe the Averages

Examine the new dataframe, `pg_crime_averages`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the average number of incidents per month for each category. Which categories have the highest average number of incidents per month? Which have the lowest? What does this tell you about the pattern of crime in Prince George's County? Are there categories that you have questions about? Why or why not?

Robbery residential didn't really have an average. The lowest were assault with a weapon, assualt shooting, b&e other, and sex offense. The highest categories were accident and theft from auto. Auto related crimes look to be a lot higher which is interesting. Theft. is pretty high. I'm surprised that homicide is so low with everyhting else being so high. I'm wondering how robbery residential is so low while breaking and entering is higher because you would think that people would break and enter and also steal something,  


### Task 6: Testing a Theory

One theory about crime is that it is more likely to occur in the summer months. Test this theory by creating three new columns using `mutate()` that calculate the percentage change compared to the average for each category of crime for the months of June, July, and August. Call the new columns `june_change`, `july_change`, and `august_change`. Assign the result to a new dataframe called `summer_crime_averages`.

```{r}
summer_crime_averages<- average_incidents %>%
  mutate(
    june_change = ((Jun - average) / average) * 100,
    july_change = ((Jul - average) / average) * 100,
    august_change = ((Aug - average) / average) * 100)

```

### Task 7: Describe the Summer Crime Averages

Look at the `summer_crime_averages` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change in the average number of incidents per month for each category of crime for the months of June, July, and August. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about the theory that crime is more likely to occur in the summer months?

Theft from auto and accidents see an increase in the summer, which makes sense because more people travel by car during that time period. Some more violent crimes did not increase which shows how crime overall doesn't increase over the summer. People in the summer also may leave their cars unattended. 


### Task 8: What's the Story?

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story focused on the crime data in Prince George's County. It could be from any of the dataframes you've created in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

Vehicle related crime in Prince Georges County is the highest reported crime amongst crimes like breaking and entering, homicide and sex offense, according to a data report. 

Prince Georges County's highest crime reported is vehicle accidents with an average of around 481 total accidents happening this past year, according to the data. When compared to residential robbery, which was the lowest average, accidents seem to be significantly higher. 

### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.
